We are first just going to have the game start off as a text based Arena fighting game


    Think about the way that a pokemon fight works
    


We will need a player and We will need an enemy
    These are actually pretty related
    So, these should inherit from a base class of FIGHTER
    

lets talk about our FIGHTER base class

    Fighter will need a few things -
        
        
        Variables
            NAME
            
            int Array[] stats = { health, attack, defense, speed }
            
            LATER
            Weapon weapon
            
            LATER
            implement more, but just keep that for now
            Armor Array[] armor = { helmet, chest, lowerBody }
            
            
            
            
            LATER
            Not totally sure on the implementation of inventory
            
            Maybe an enum for inventory
                Inventory should be -
                    Weapon, Health Potions, Attribute boost potions, Armor
                    
                And then perhaps an array that coordinates with inventory enum
                
            
            LATER
            Maybe Armor should be its own class
            
            
            
            Maybe an enum for attributes/stats
                HP, Attack, Defense, Speed
            And then perhaps an array that coordinates with the Attributes/Stats enum
                int array[] { 100 (health), 50(attack), 60(defense), 30(speed) }
                
                
            
            maybe an enum for attackTypes
            or a separate struct/class for attackTypes
                attackTypes struct would contain -
                    Damage
                    Accuracy
            
            
        
        
        Functions
            gonna need a constructor to set all of the members
            
            getter for health
            
            getter for all stats
            
            
            
            LATER
            getter for weapon
            getter for armor?
            
            
            a function to deal with losing health
            it should take as a parameter, the amount of damage an enemy attack did
            and updates health -
                health -= attackDamage
            
            
            a function to calculate amount of damage an attack will do
            parameters - attackType, fighterAttack stat, defender Defense stat
            
                switch statement to compute damage based on attackType
            
                does some sort of calculation using all of these to get a damage output
            
                returns damageOutput
                
            
            
            
        
            
Now lets talk about our player class

playerClass inherits everything from base class






a Basic run through of the game

user is presented with text detailing -
    oponent stats
    user stats
    
Asks user if they want to start fight

user goes first
    user is presented with 3 attack options -
        1. heavy
        2. normal
        3. quick
        
    user inputs attackDecision
    
    Functions to determine damage output and if attack Hits/Misses
    
    if attack Hits
        subtract damage output from health of enemy
    else
        say attack missed
        
Enemy Turn
    much of the same, except that everything is determined by an RNG
    

Fight ends when -
    Enemy health hits 0 - USER WINS
    Player health hits 0 - LOSES
